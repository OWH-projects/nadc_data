HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES|1821 N. 73RD ST., OMAHA, NE 68114|4025952816|BARRY DEJONG|SERVICE AREA ADMIN.|     The first area identified was in regards to a potential conflict of interest if the public employee can make a decision that may cause financial benefit to a member of their family. In My case there is not potential conflict because of the following: his salary is set by an independent governing board. It is not contingent on the number of clients served. I have no input into the rates paid for services, the ability to contract with the provider or if consumers chose that provider.               The second area of concern deals with the potential to obtain confidential information for financial gain for a family member. His role as a public official offers access to confidential information necessary to administer to the needs of the people we serve. This is the same information that our other business partners have. It is not useful in anyway other than to provide supports that people have asked for. In both my role and Mr. Brinker's role as the administrator of a human service agency there are controls in place to ensure the highest level of confidentiality. |||||||

Wilderness Heights-shown as Final Action on S. 40th and Yankee Hill Rd.  Wilderness Heights is owned by Lincoln Federal Bank. Lincoln Federal is a partial owner of an LLC, LFSH, LLC, which LLC is a joint venture partner with Capitol Title in a business called Lincoln Title. Capitol Title Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of HomeServices of Nebraska, Inc., of which I am the Chief Operating Officer, but not an owner.|Financial benefits to the Company may be realized if the developer/owner lists the property above-described with either Woods Bros. Realty or Home Real Estate or utilizes title insurance or escrow closing services of the joint venture, Lincoln Title, in conjunction with the eventual sale of such property. Any benefit to HomeServices as a result of the joint venture with Lincoln Title would not be direct, but would simply be  a portion of overala profits/loss of the JV as determined.    At present there is not an agreement for the Developer to list these properties with a HomeServices Company and there are not any Lincoln Federal lots currently with Home or Woods Bros. Because there is no current agreement, I am uncertain when or whether such properties may in the future be listed with a HomeServices Company. If listings were with an agent on the 100% commission plan the Company would not receive any direct monetary commission benefit other than a small broker's administrative commission on the first two transacions each year. 100% agents keep the total of their commission and pay a non-varying flat marketing fee to the company rather than splitting commission.    Any benefit to the Company as a result of a Buyer's use of a HOME or Woods agent, or use of Capitol Title is purely speculative and the nature of any such benefit would be dependent upon the agent who was involved in such transaction.||||1|Home Services of NE, Inc.|

As part of this process, Section 4, now codified as 79-1104.01, requires that the NE Dept. of Education (NDE) select and enter into an agreement with an endowment provider.  It is my understanding that the NE Children and Families Foundation (NCFF) of which I am a board member, anticipates submitting a proposal to NDE to be selected as the endowment provider.  Under Section 2 of Article VII of the NE Constitution and 79-301(1), the NDE is composed of the State Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education.  Therefore, both the Commissioner and the State Board of Education, of which I am a member, will be required to approve the aggreement with the endowment provider.  The State Board may also vote on the selection of the endowment provider.  These actions will most likely take place at the December 2006 Board Meeting.  It is my understanding that the NCFF will benefit financially, directly or indirectly, if it is selected and enters into an agreement with NDE to be the endowment provider.

I, Gary Hamer, in my position as Deputy Director of the Department, was going to serve on the proposal evaluation committee, and participate in the final selection of a contractor to carry out the functions of the Act. However, one of the potential bidders is a corporatin known as Invest Nebraska. I am currently serving, in an appointed position, as a director on the board of such organization.    As a result of my business association with Invest Nebraska, I will be removed from the porposal evaluation committee and will no longer participate in the final selection of a contractor. I will also refrain from participating in the development of a proposal for submission to the Department of Economic Development on behalf of Invest Nebraska. |In the event that Invest Nebraska does submit a bid in response to the RFP, and in the event that Invest Nebraska is selected through the public bidding process to be awarded the contract, Invest Nebraska would be awarded $250,000 each year, for two years (provided that Invest Nebraska could satisfy the matching requirements). There would be no personal financial benefit. I do not receive a salary ro any fees for my membership on the board. |1|||1|Invest Nebraska|

I have no doubt that this would certainly be a conflict of Interest if we were trying to sell the building or tear it douwn and re-hab it. However, this is not the case since the landlord has already remodeled the building and prefers to rent it out. I have never had a prospective tenant that inquired about blight and TIF districts or made a decision on that basis, and declaring the neighborhood blighted bould not result in any higher rents for the landlord nor higher commissions for me. Generally, however , tenants DO ask if ownership might be a possibility at some point, so we do say in our advertising that the owner would consider selling it, although we do not officially have it listed for sale at this time. I would like to see if this is a conflict of interest and if I should abstain from voting.

A new dealership at S. 33rd Street and Yankee Hill Road (Special Permit 09022 and Change of Zone 09025) and the expansion of a dealership at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road (Special Permit 07015A). The new dealership at Yankee Hill Road is approximately one mile southeast of DuTeau and the dealership on S. 27th Street is directly across the street to the west of DuTeau.    DuTeau Chevrolet Subaru is in the process of acquiring land for the relocation of the Subaru franchise. Our original plans were to acquire the land at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road but we were unsuccessful. This is the same parcel of land covered by Special Permit 07015A and scheduled for hearing on October 21st.    Due to my history with S. 27th and Tamarin Ridge Road and the proximity of both auto dealership applications, I would feel most comfortable declaring a conflict of interest.|Proximity of competing auto dealerships.

The DSC would involve a new methodology in City interaction with the development community and/or construction and remodeling of new space in the City-County Building and co-location of several departments or representatives from several departments.    The DSC concept was presented to the Lincoln/Lancaster County Public Building Commission with a request to have the construction started. The Public Building Commission asked the Mayor to first get approval from the Lincoln City Council, which is now being instigated with an informational meeting on June 29, 2009.    Secondary to the DSC is the possibility the City will relocate part or all of its Urban Development Department to the City-County Building to be close to the DSC. The Urban Development lease with Haymarket Square expires on February 28, 2010.    The question is whether discussion on the creation of the Development Services Center creates a conflict of interest for Jon Camp, who, through his ownership in Haymarket Square Partnership, currently leases space to the Urban Development. The Lease for Urban Development terminates on February 28, 2010, unless the City exercises its option to renew.    The issue is whether a DSC should be created.    The City of Lincoln can relocate the Urban Development Department regardless of whether the DSC is created.    Thus, can Jon Camp participate in discussions concerning the Development Services Center?     |Jon Camp is a majority partner in Haymarket Square Developers, a general partnership. Haymarket Square currently leases office space to the City of Lincoln's Urban Development Department under a lease that expires February 28, 2010. The City of Lincoln has six one-year renewal options, exercisable solely at the discretion of the City.|1||Jon Camp|1|Haymarket Square|

Pinewood Bowl is an outdoor entertainment facility that accommodates 3,000 or more patrons for activities such as musical events or plays.  Pinewood Bowl is located in Pioneers Park, a City-owned facility.    The Pioneers Park Nature Center is located in a portion of City-owned Pioneers Park and has the ability to serve functions of approximately 80 individuals. It is located near wildlife pastures with such animals at North American Bison    Auld Pavilion is a dance hall constructed in the 1920s or 1930s that accommodates functions up to approximately 20 individuals.  Auld Pavilion is City-owned and located in Antelope Park, west of Capitol Blvd. and 33rd Street, adjacent to children's playgrounds and picnic shelters.    Jon Camp has served on the Lincoln City Council for 12 years since May 1999.    Jon Camp started redeveloping properties in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket in August 1982 and continues to do so.    Jon Camp owns properties located in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket through the Haymarket Square Partnership (HMS), the CH, LTD Corporation (CH Ltd.) and the AJC Investments, LLC (AJC).  These properties include 9 buildings that are utilized for commercial, retail, and office spaces.  Within two buildings are three reception facilities: (1) the Ridnour Room, (2) North Apothecary Loft, and (3) South Apothecary Loft.    The Apothecary Lofts have master bedroom suites making them unique and different from other venues in Lincoln.  The Ridnour Room is a reception facility that can accommodate 300 guests.  All three facilities are different than other venues because no food nor beverage catering is provided by CH, Ltd.|The matter before the Lincoln City Council raises the question of whether permitting alcohol at City Park facilities will have financial impact or effect on the business of Jon Camp.    First, within the City of Lincoln, there are a wide variety and number of facilities offering reception rooms that will have minimal, if any financial impact on Jon Camp's three facilities. This includes venues like golf courses, restaurants with party rooms, pure reception facilities, and hotels and motels with reception areas.    Second, the targeted clientele of Mr. Camp's three facilities represent a different demographic due to the pricing structure and quality of the facilities.    Third, features offered by the Apothecary Lofts are different that those of the City because the Apothecary Lofts also are more similar to lodging facilities.  In fact, CH, Ltd. charges "lodging taxes" on overnight stays.    Fourth, the Apothecary Lofts and the Ridnour Room are unique because guests have complete freedom and flexibility to handle food and beverage service as they desire.  Facility hosts can even bring in their own food and beverages.    The NADC should consider whether ownership of Mr. Camp of properties in the Historic Haymarket will incur financial gains or losses due to the addition of alcohol.  Mr. Camp's properties are located in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket, which is several miles away from the Auld Pavilion and much further way from Pinewood Bowl and the Nature Center, both of which are located in Pioneers Park.    Because the Auld Pavilion and the Nature Center already market to weddings and other activities, will there be financial gain/loss to Mr. Camp beyond any financial gain/loss that currently exists.    Because Mr. Camp commenced his development in Historic Haymarket in 1982, he has provided leadership in the modern era of Haymarket and continues to do so.  However, to disqualify Mr. Camp from considering a project before the Lincoln City Council should be analyzed on an individual basis, which is the purpose of this application.    In this particular case, the existence of a very competitive market for reception facilities insulates Mr. Camp from any real conflict of interest in this present matter.|1|||1|Haymarket Square CH, Ltd|

I am a member of the school board and also a local substitute. The Elementary School secretary makes calls to fill the substitute positions for the district. I was approved as a local sub this past year and so renewed a previous certificate that I had let expire when I was running a restaurant. I have asked the secretary to only call me if they are unable to find anyone else as we have a farming and ranching operation that takes most of my time and energy.  The farm is our livlihood. When I am gone from the farm it puts a hardship on my husband and he usually hires someone to help him if I am going to be gone. The school was in need of a "long term" sub to fill in while the preschool teacher was out on maternity leave. They could not find anyone so I told them I would fill the morning(preschool) position if they could find someone else to take her afternoon duties at the high school as I could not be away from the farm all day.  They were able to find a retired teacher who was willing to take the afternoon duties  but did not want anything to do with the preschool. I did fill in for 5 1/2 weeks in October and November, mornings only, while the teacher was out on leave. We have a split board and other members of the board believe that sine I have a "financial interest' because I am "employed" by the district that I should not be able to vote when it comes time for renewing the Superintendent's contract.  My husband hired two people to help him while I was in town substituting. I feel like I was doing my community a service and was not in it "for the money" as it cost us $18 per hour to hire the help while I was gone. I believe in helping my school and my community when needed and would like to be able to make myself available when the school is in a crunch but I don't want to interfere with my duties on the board. I would like your opinion as to whether this constitutes a conflict of interest with my duties as a board member and whether I need to abstain when voting on issues dealing with the superintendent|I don't believe there is a financial benefit because of the payout for farm help but I did receive substitute pay for the time I spent filling in for the preschool teacher.  I do not see any long term benefit since I always ask them to try to find someone else and to only call me as a last resort. We have hired several more local subs in the past month and a half so there should be a larger pool for them to call before they would call me.    Two of the board members also have wives who are local subs and fill in pretty regularly. One of the wives was not called in this instance because they like to use her at the high school because she is a better fit there and I did see her several times during the time I was filing in.  Her husband and his best buddy on the board are the main ones questioning whether I should be able to vote. The other board members wife was called but she turned it down because they were harvesting corn. Several other subs I spoke with also turned it down because of the timing-most are involved with farming and ranching in some way and fall is a very busy time for us all.|1|||||

Stat. $77-2734.04 and 77-2734.14 to define terms and to change provisions relating to the apportionment of income between states for the purposes of taxation. The intent of the bill, according to Sen. Hadley, is to provide that for purposes of income taxation, the sale of intangibles and services be treated the same as current Nebraska law treats the sale of manufactured and retail tangible goods and imposes the state income tax based on a market-based source of income approach rather than the current "all or nothing" cost of performance approach. According to the Nebraska Department of Revenue, LB 872 will increase corporate income tax for corporations located outside of Nebraska that provide services or intangibles to customers located in Nebraska (LB 872 Fiscal Note, dated January 25, 2012).    At the public committee hearing for LB 872 on January 27, 2012, the Nebraska Broadcasters Association raised concerns with the bill. It is my understanding that the Association is now working on a proposed amendment that would exempt broadcast companies from the scope of this bill. |As a part owner of two radio stations in Nebraska, the passage of this bill in its original form could result in a change in both the availability and cost of the services or intangibles consumed by my businesses that come from providers outside of the State.   |1|||1|KUSO-FM and KNEN-FM|If you will not abstain from acting on a matter state why, despite the potential conflict, you intend to vote or otherwise participate.

This is for a Walmart which will have full access to 27th street at Grainger Parkway and right in/right out access at Jamie Lane. While the appeal has several issues the potential conflict concerns the request for walmart to eliminate access to Grainger Parkway and take full access from Jamie Lane.    I'm one of the owners of DuTeau Subaru at 2750 Jamie Lane. It is possible that if Jamie Lane and 27th Street changes from a right in/right out intersection to full access my business could reap some benefit. Personally I believe that DuTeau Subaru has great access with the current road network and full access will not provide any real benefit.    In order to avoid any appearance of a conflict, I request a ruling from the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission. Duteau Subaru is part of a parcel of commercially zoned land. This triangle of land is bounded by South 27th Street, Jamie Lane and Granger Parkway. Currently the only access to DuTeau Subaru is from Jamie Lane, but when the land to the north develops there will be access to Granger Parkway via an internal roadway system. |A full access intersection at South 27th and Jamie Lane could provide greater access for our customers. ||||1|DuTeau Subaru|

The proposed amendment would remove paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Section 6-428 of ordinance 5165.  This portion of the ordinance has been enforced because the constitutionality of this portion of the ordinance has been the subject of a lawsuit aginst the city since it was passed.    Paragraph 2 of the ordiance makes it unlawful for any person or entity that owns a rental unit in the city of fremont to harbor an illegal alien in the dwelling unit...unless such harboring is otherwise expressly permitted by federal law.    Paragraph 3 requires anyone age 18 or older to obtain an "occupancy license" prior to occupying any leased or rented dwelling unit.    Paragraph 4 outlines the enforcement requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3.    A potential conflict of interest exists because removing this portion of the oridance may effect the demand for housing in fremont, nebraska.|An argument has been made that I could benefit financially if the "occupancy license" provision was removed because illegal aliens would be occupying housing in fremont, nebraska, increasing demand for housing which in turm increases rental rates and occupancy rates.

This city resolution would authorize the use of $5.728 Million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) for the P Street Streetscape Project in Downtown Lincoln, roughly from Centennial Mall on the East to North 9th Street on the West. The question is that, since I reside in a 10th floor condominium in the University Towers, located at the 128 N. 13th St, the NE corner of 13th and P Streets, do i have a conflict of interest that would prohibit me from voting on this resolution?|This project is intended to improve traffic patterns, parking, and sidewalk access to businesses along the P Street corridor. My spouse and I are residents of the condominiums at 13th and P. We do not stand to receive any direct benefit, but could see increased property values as a result. However, that could also be said about most projects in the downtown area. |1|1|Janet Hannah Eskridge|||As stated above, I do not perceive that there is a direct financial benefit that results from this project. Indeed, improved traffic and parking is of little benefit to us as we live there and do not utilize on-street parking. It seems to me that this public project is a benefit for the entire community. If I owned a business located at street level, that may be different, but that is not the situation here.

FRANK TURK|CHAIRMAN OF BOARD|Date action is to be taken or decision is to be made: Future Action    One of the new initiatives that the Nebraska Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Board is advocating for is complete pediatric hearing aid insurance coverage for Nebraska children under the age of 18. The Board, as a secondary point, is also seeking to require all insurance companies to have hearing aid coverage as an essential health care benefit in Nebraska for adults. In addition, for those insurance companies that do provide hearing aid coverage, advocate for better coverage as a health care benefit coverage limits are too low. Due to the complexity of healthcare laws on the federal and state level such advocacy will have to be done a number of different levels. At this point, advocacy will include asking the state personal department to increase its health insurance benefits for state employees and submit formal comments to the Federal HHS that the Nebraska Essential Health Benefits should include complete pediatric hearing aid coverage and require all insurance plans in the state to provide hearing aid coverage. The Board in giving guidance and direction in its September 11, 2015 meeting will expect a more detailed report on how to achieve this specific goal in its Board meeting on December 11, 2015 and is expected to take a more formal vote on the additional steps based on additional research and due diligence. It is possible in our research that we will also be advocating that such coverage for all Nebraskans should be classified as preventative or habilitative in nature which would make it 100% covered.    Hearing Loss Association of American estimates 20% of the population have some form of hearing loss. With that in mind it is estimated that 20% of Nebraska State Employees have some form of hearing loss but we believe an estimated 5% may actually use hearing aids.|I wear a hearing aid and receive my health care benefit coverage from the state. It is possible that I will be purchasing a new hearing aid in the next two to three years. If the state insurance coverage increases the amount paid for a hearing aid it will reduce the amount of money I would have to pay out of pocket for the new hearing aid. Current policy limits cover up to $1,500 for every three years.|1|||||

These elections are on the ballots of the Primary/General Elections.    I was elected to serve on the Plattsmouth Rural Fire Board at the September 2, 2015 Annual Fire Board Meeting. This election is done by secret ballot by the registered voters present during the Annual Meeting.     When a member of the Fire Board discovered that I was running for the board I received the following notice from him that he indicated came from their attorney. I requested the written letter from the attorney, but have not received a copy.     "Being a member of the Cass County Board of Commissioners presents a conflict when it comes to voting on anything before the County Board that involves the rural fire district if that commissioner is an elected member of that District. The county commissioner would be placed in a position to abstain from voting on any action before the county board that involves the rural fire district. Example:  If the Budget of the Rural Fire District is before the County Board for approval, a conflict exists. If the County Commissioner that is a member of the Rural Fire District voted for or against the budget of the District, such action by that county commissioner could place both the county board and the rural fire district in a situation to render that action null and void. It could also cause an issue where the county commissioner would be unable to contribute to a discussion or vote involving the rural fire district if it comes to any action that was discussed by the Rural District Board in Closed Session."    There is no way I or my family benefit financially from being on the fire board or create a detriment to the public official or public employee. I had previously checked with the Cass County Attorney and he agrees, but suggest that I check with this office.    I am not paid any money for being on the fire board. I do receive a salary from the County for being on the County board, and the County Board votes on what this salary is to be, as well as the salaries of all County Employees.    The County does approve all of the County Fire Board Budgets as part of the County Budget, again I do not benefit monetarily from this vote.     I also serve on the SID#7 Board and the only time that something came to the County Board was the item to allow the SID to purchase some lots for back taxes with the understanding they had to be sold within 3-years. I did abstain from this vote. The lots were sold within one year and there was no financial benefit to me or my family.    Please let me know if I do have a conflict and if there is any voting on the Fire Board or the County Board that I need to abstain from.    I did not fill out Item 4, as I do not believe that there is a conflict of interest.    Sincerely,     Janet M. McCartney     |||||||

The County zoning administrator, and five of the seven members of the Hall County Board have also been named as Defendants in the lawsuit in both their official and individual capacities. Plaintiff alleges that he intends to file or application for conditional use permits and/or seek zoning changes, but has not yet done so. Plaintiff alleges that the personal or religious beliefs of the Board members make them unable to fairly consider any zoning regulation petitions he may file. Further, the Board members believe that legal counsel will be recommending proposed changes to the zoning regulations and/or other legislation affecting adult businesses, and that they will be called upon to act on such proposals in the near future.  |  The County of Hall and Individually named members of the Board of Supervisors could see financial benefit or detriment in connection with the pending civil lawsuit referenced above, depending on how the Board acts with respect to any proposed zoning regulation amendments and/or other legislative actions which might affect adult entertainment businesses, and/or any applications/petitions that might be submitted in the future by the Plaintiff in the above described.  |1|||||
